In this notebook we will show how the direct human impact $\\boldsymbol{d}$ can be calculated as a result of an absolute environemental sustainability assessment (AESA). It is worth noting that the introduction of some concepts in this notebook is done breifly to focus on the implementation of the methods.

    "To briefly describe the planetary boundaries framework (PBF), it aims to evaluate the change in the state of the Earth system and whether human activites can be sustainable given some \"safe values\" of state control variables. These state control variables represent 9 key biophysical systems that are guiding the overall Earth system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having introduced briefly what the PBF is about, what is really important in this framework to set is a reference year of assessment. It is typically a year in the pre-industrial era (e.g., 1750). At that specific year the state of a specific state control variable of a biophysical system is taken as reference. Let us call that state control variable at the reference year $X_0$ and $X$ the new state of the control variable. \n",

    "In life cycle assessment (LCA) this is precisely what impact assessment attempt to do when developping characterisation factors which we will denote mathematically by $c_{f_i}$. A $c_f$ aims to characterisethe impact caused by the emission of elementary flows denoted $e_i$. An elementary flow $e_i$ is a unique specie/substance/material/resource that is either emitted/extracted to/from biosphere due to activities in the technosphere. In LCA, the goal is first to obtain the full list of elementary flows interacting with a product system. The sum of all characterised elementary flows gives an impact score in absolute terms that represents the change to a specific environmental category due to the emission/extraction of elementary flows (as done in Equation 8).\n",

    "To be meaningful, these results compared to another system (benchmarked or not) to assess the relative environmental performance of a product system. For more details in this topic, readers are referred to Hauschild et al.[1]. However, the relative comparison between product systems does not inform in any way whether these are sustainable. For instance, from a climate change perspective, one can find that hydrogen production via steam methane reforming (SMR) is worse than methane pyrolysis. What the LCA study would have proven is that relative to SMR, methane pyrolysis is eco-efficient. When compared to the carrying capacity of the earth, one may find methane pyrolysis far from being sustainable. That is the difference between eco-efficiency and -effectiveness. Eco-effectiveness has been termed for the first time by Bjørn et al.[2] and led to the emergence of the absolute environmental sustainability assessment (AESA) which, unlike traditional LCA, reports results relative to the Earth carrying capacity.\n",

    "In simple terms, we obtain the direct impact $d_X$ of a product system relative to its dedicated environmental space ${\\omega_X} = \\Delta X_{PB}$ (see equation 9). In equation 9, $\\alpha$ is the allocation factor for the product system in question and $X_{P B}$ the state control variable representing the boundary of the biophysical system. This general formulation is used by AESA practitioners to establish if a product system is sustainable based on the condition in equation 10.\n",
