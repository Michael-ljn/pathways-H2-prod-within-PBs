    "# **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous notebook](1_00_total_impact.ipynb#1-introduction), we introduced several concepts including the direct human impact represented by the vector $\\boldsymbol{d}$ in equations (1). In this notebook we will show how the direct human impact $\\boldsymbol{d}$ can be calculated as a result of an absolute environemental sustainability assessment (AESA). It is worth noting that the introduction of some concepts in this notebook is done **breifly** to focus on the implementation of the methods rather than providing extensive details.\n",
    "\n",
    "To briefly describe the planetary boundaries framework (PBF), it aims to evaluate the change in the state of the Earth system and whether human activites can be operating within a space delimited by \"safe\" boundary values of state control variables. This space is commonly called safe operaring space (SOS). These state control variables represent 9 key biophysical systems that are guiding the overall Earth system according to the framework††. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having introduced briefly the PBF, in this framework, it important to set is a reference year of assessment. It is typically a year during the pre-industrial era (e.g., 1750). At that specific year, the state the overall Earth system is taken as reference. Let us call $X_{z}^0$ the state of a specific control variable for a biophysical system $z$ at the reference year and $X_z$ the new state. Note that $z \\in S$ and $S$ is the set of all 9 guiding biophysical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refer back to the SOS, it conceptually represent the maximum displacement of the state of a control variable $X_z$ can have from its reference state $X_{z}^0$. This displacement is represented by $\\Delta X_z^{PB}$, which is the difference between the current state and the reference state. Mathematically, we can represent it by using equation 7.\n",

    "\\Delta X_z^{PB} =\\left|X_z^{PB}- X_z^0 \\right| \\tag{11}\n",

    "Given the above, the direct human impact $d_z$ can be defined as the vector of displacements of the state of control variables from their reference state. Mathematically, we can represent it by using equation 9. In this equation, $\\alpha$ is a factor between 0 and 1 that represents the share of the SOS in proportion to the displacement of the state of a control variable caused by human activities. For example for all human activities $\\alpha = 1$ is equal to 1, while for a specific human activity $\\alpha$ will be infinately lower than 1. The definition of $\\alpha$ for the global hydrogen production is simulated in the [Notebook 2.02](./2_02_allocated_space.ipynb). Equation has the same format as performed in AESA, where a impact from life cycle assessment is compared to an environmental space dedicated to a product system. \n",

    "To be meaningful, LCIA results are typically compared to another system (benchmarked or not) to assess the relative environmental performance of a product system. For more details in this topic, readers are referred to Hauschild et al.[1]. However, the relative comparison between product systems does not inform in any way whether these are sustainable. For instance, from a climate change perspective, one can find that hydrogen production via steam methane reforming (SMR) is worse than methane pyrolysis. What the LCA study would have proven is that relative to SMR, methane pyrolysis is eco-efficient. When compared to the carrying capacity of the earth, one may find methane pyrolysis far from being sustainable. That is the difference between eco-efficiency and -effectiveness. Eco-effectiveness has been termed for the first time by Bjørn et al.[2] and led to the emergence of the absolute environmental sustainability assessment (AESA) which, unlike traditional LCA, reports results relative to the Earth carrying capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, we obtain the direct normalised impact $d_z$ of a product system relative to its dedicated environmental space $\\Delta X_z^{PB}$ (see equation 9). In equation 9, $\\alpha$ is the allocation factor for the product system in question and $X_z^{PB}$ the state control variable representing the boundary of the biophysical system. This general formulation is used by AESA practitioners to establish if a product system is sustainable based on the condition in equation 10 and typically assuming that equation 6 applies e.g., $d_z=x_z$ and where $x_z$ would be the normalised new state of a control variable after impact.\n",
