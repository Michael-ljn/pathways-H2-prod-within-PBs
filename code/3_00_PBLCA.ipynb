    "\n",
    "In life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) the aim is to develop characterisation factors which we will denote mathematically by $Q_{ze}$ as it would belong to a Matrix $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ of $z$ impact categories rows per $e$ elmentary flows colums. $Q_{ze}$ aims to characterise the impact caused on the state of a biophysical system $z$ by the emission/extraction of elementary flows denoted $g_e$. An elementary flow $g_e$ is a unique specie/substance/material/resource that is either emitted/extracted to/from biosphere due to activities in the technosphere. In LCA, the goal is first to obtain the full list of elementary flows interacting with a product system. The sum of all characterised elementary flows gives an impact score in absolute terms that represents the change to a specific environmental category due to the emission/extraction of elementary flows (as done in Equation 14).\n",
